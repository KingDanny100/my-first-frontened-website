        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
           It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
           JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
            provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
           language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
          Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <code></code>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to 
              control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow 
              an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
               events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id='What_you_should_already_know' class='main-section'>
        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
      </ul>
        
      </section>
      <section id='Javascript_and_Java' class='main-section'>
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
           The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
           naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
            which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, 
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or 
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, 
          and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
       
      </section>
      <section id='Hello_world' class='main-section'>
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <p></p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code>
      </section>
      <section id='Variables' class='main-section'>
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
              called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
           <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
             You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in 
             identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
          
        </section>
      <section id='Declaring_variables' class='main-section'>
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <code>var x = 58</code>
          
      </section>
      <section id='Variable_scope' class='main-section'>
          <header>Variable scope</header>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, 
              because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, 
              it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
          <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
               local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.</p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        </section>
        <section id='global_variables' class='main-section'>
          <header>Global variables</header>
          <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, 
              so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
           <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in
               one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name.</p>
          
        </section>
        <section id='Constants' class='main-section'>
          <header>Constants</header>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a 
              constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
               or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. 
              If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
              <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
              <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                  "otherValue";</code>
        </section>
        <section id='Data_types' class='main-section'>
          <header>Data types</header>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
              <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to
               perform useful functions with your applications. 
              Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='If_else' class='main-section'>
          <header>If...else statement</header>
          <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. 
              Use the optional else clause to execute a 
              statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          </p>
          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          <p></p>
          <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }</code>
          
        </section>
        <section id='function_declaration' class='main-section'>
          <header>Function declaration</header>
          <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, 
              or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
              <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
